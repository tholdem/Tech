\begin{problem}[3]
Note that I used $ (x,1) \sim (f(x),0)$ for the problem.

We wish to use SvK (note that it might be easier to figure out via building a CW-complex). Let $ v$ be the wedge point of $ X$, and let $ U_0$ be the thickened $ \{v\} \times I$ which is open. Define $ A = U_0 \cup X \times I \setminus \{\frac{1}{2}\} ,B = X \times \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4} \right) $ as figure shown.

Choose the base point $x_0:= \{v\} \times \{\frac{2}{5}\}$ (yellow) so that it is contained in $ A,B,A \cap B$. By pushing the bottom up (so the base becomes $ X \times \{\frac{2}{5}\} $) and applying the identification on the top, \emph{i.e.} we can pretend that $ (f(x),1) \in X \times \{\frac{2}{5}\} $, thus $ A$ has the shown homotopy equivalence. Clearly $ B$ is homotopic to  $ X$ by collapsing the height. Lastly,  $ A \cap B$ is homotopic to a wedge of 4 circles by collapsing to the skeleton. Therefore, we have $ \pi_1( A \cap B) = \langle a,b,c,d| \rangle$, $ \pi_1( A) = \langle x,y,z| \rangle$ and $ \pi_1( B) = \langle x',y'| \rangle$. 

Now let's see what inclusion map induces on the fundamental groups. When we include $ a,b$ in  $ A$, they are precisely $ x,y$ respectively. When we include  $ c,d$ in  $ A$, we push them to the top so they are identified with loops postcomposed with $f$. Note that for $ c,d$ to be expressed by $ x,y$, they must travel down first along  $ z$ in the $ A$ skeleton to get the correct orientation. That is, $ c \mapsto z f_*(x) z^{-1}$ and $ d \mapsto zf_*(y)z^{-1}$. It is clear that for $ A \cap B \to B$ we just map $ a,c \mapsto x',b,d\mapsto y'$. Thus the fibered coproduct is
\begin{align*}
	\pi_1( T_f) &= \langle x,y,z,x',y'|x(x')^{-1},y(y')^{-1},zf_*(x)z^{-1}x', zf_*(y)z^{-1}y' \rangle \\
	&= \langle x,y,z|zf_*(x)z^{-1}x^{-1}, zf_*(y)z^{-1}y^{-1} \rangle .
\end{align*}

Since $ \pi_1( S^{1} \vee S^{1}) = \zz*\zz =F_2$, and by the correspondence theorem, index $ n$ subgroups of $ F_2$ corresponds to $ n$-fold covering spaces of  $ S^{1} \vee S^{1}$, it suffices find a normal and non-normal 3-fold covers of $ S^{1} \vee S^{1}$. In the figure, it is straightforward to verify that both are 3-fold covers. The right figure is clearly normal as it has $ \frac{\pi}{ 3}$ rotational symmetry, which is the automorphism that maps between points in $ p^{-1}(x_0)$. It corresponds to a normal subgroup $ N = \langle a,b^2,ba^2b,babab \rangle$. I claim that the left figure is not normal. In particular, there is no deck transformation that maps $ \widetilde{ x}_0$ to $ \widetilde{ x}_1$, since the lift of $ a$ based at  $ \widetilde{ x}_0$ is a loop. and the lift of $ a$ based at  $ \widetilde{ x}_1$ is a path, and they cannot be homeomorphic so no deck transformation sends $ \widetilde{ x}_0$ to $ \widetilde{ x}_1$. It corresponds to $ H = \langle b,a^3,aba^2,a^2ba,ababa \rangle$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[7]
Since $ S^{n}$ is simply connected, any $ f: S^{n} \to X$ satisfies the lifting criterion $ f_*( \pi_1(S^{n})) = p_*(\widetilde{ X}) = 0$. Thus we obtain a lift $ \widetilde{ f}: S^{n} \to X$. Since $ \widetilde{ X}$ is contractible, $ \widetilde{ f}$ is homotopic to the constant map via $ H: S^{n} \times I \to \widetilde{ X}$. As we see from the figure, since $ H(x,1)$ is constant, we can quotient it out to $ H':S^{n} \times I / S^{n} \times \{1\} \to \widetilde{ X}$. The quotient is a cone of $ S^{n}$, clearly homeomorphic to $ D^{n+1}$ with $ \widetilde{ f}$ on the boundary. Denote this modified $ H'$ as  $ \widetilde{ H}: D^{n+1} \to \widetilde{ X}$. Thus we obtain a map $ F:= p \circ \widetilde{ H} : D^{n+1} \to X$, and $ F|_{ \partial D^{n+1}} = p \circ \widetilde{ f} = f$ so it is the extension we seek.

\begin{problem}[8]
	We shall define $ f$ inductively on the skeletons of  $ Y$. Since  $ Y^{(0)}$ is a discrete set of points, define $ f_0 : Y^{(0)} \to X, y \mapsto x_0$, and it is a constant map so it is continuous. Since $ Y$ is path-connected,  $ Y^{(1)}$ must be path-connected too, since the paths between 0-cells must traverse the 1-cells. We can quotient all 0-cells and paths between them so that $ Y^{(1)}$ becomes a wedge of circles. Clearly we can trace out each circle via a loop, $ \gammag$. Then take any representative $ \eta \in \phi([ \gamma]): S^{1} \to X$ and define that to be $ f$ on that circle (think of circle as the quotient of an interval via attaching maps). Doing this for all circles yields a continuous map via the universal property of quotient map map defined for all circles $ f_1: Y^{(1)} \to X$ where $ f_1$ is constant on the 0-cells and 1-cells connecting the 0-cells, so $ f_1$ clearly extends $ f_0$.

	Next, we consider $ Y^{(2)}$, which is obtained from $ Y^{(1)}$ by attaching $ D^2$. Since any attaching map $ a: S^{1} \to Y^{(1)}$ extends to a characteristic map bounding a disk $ D^2 \to Y^{(1)}$, $ D^2$ is contractible and $ Y^{(1)}$ path-connected, $ a$ is nullhomotopic. Since $ a$ introduces a relation in  $ \pi_1( Y) $, there exists some words in $ \pi_1( Y) $ that gets killed. Since $ \phi$ is a homomorphism, we see that $ \phi={f_1}_*$ takes the words to constant as well, making $ f_1 \circ a: S^{1} \to X$ also nullhomotopic. Thus it extends to a map  $ D^2 \to X$, and we are allowed to define $ f_2$ to be this map on the 2-cell using universal property of quotient map. Doing this for all 2-cells yield $ f_2$ that extends $ f_1$. 

	We establish the base case for $ n=2$. Now for induction ($ n\geq 2)$, assume that the desired $ f_n: Y^{(n)} \to X$ is defined. For each $ D^{n+1}$ we attach to $ Y^{(n)}$ via the attaching map $ a: S^{n} \to Y$. Then $ f_n \circ a: S^{n} \to X$ extends to $ g: D^{n+1} \to X$ by Problem 7. Thus we can define a map $ h:=(f_n,g): Y^{(n)} \sqcup D^{n+1} \to X$. Since $ g(x) = f_n(a(x))$ at the gluing site, the map is constant on each equivalent class of $ Y^{(n)} \sqcup_{a} D^{n+1}$ so we obtain a continuous map $ h':Y^{(n)} \sqcup_a D^{n+1} \to X$. Constructing such map for all $ (n+1)$-cells simultaneously yields a map  $ f_{n+1}: Y^{(n+1)} \to X$, completing the inductive step.

\begin{problem}[13]
Given $ f:X \to S^{1}$, since $ \pi_1( X) $ is finite, $ f_*( \pi_1( X) )$ is also finite, and the only finite subgroup of $ \pi_1( S^{1}) \cong \zz$ is the trivial subgroup. Thus $ f_*( \pi_1( X) ) = 0 = p_*( \pi_1( \rr) )$, satisfying the lifting criterion. Thus we have a lift $ \widetilde{ f}: X \to \rr$. Since $ \rr$ is contractible, $ \widetilde{ f}$ is nullhomotopic upstairs via $ \widetilde{ H}$, and $ f$ is nullhomotopic downstairs via  $ p \circ \widetilde{ H}$.
